# PHAJAX

A little PHP and AJAX helper that combines all your AJAX calls into one. 
While at the server, it extracts this AJAX call into seperate configurable functions.

This saves you alot of bandwidth, and because it handles all of the AJAX calls, 
you don't have to worry about the boring stuff and just get your work done.

## Usage:

First of all, you want to download all of the required files to make this work.
These are: phajax-parser.js and phajax-parser.php. Once you have these two files downloaded, you're almost done.
The last thing that you should do, is set the correct file path to the phajax-parser.php file. 
(this can be done through the phajax-parser.js file)

HTML

 `<script src="../js/phajax-parser.js" charset="utf-8"></script>`
